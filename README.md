Security Analysis of Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) by Simulating Attacks on the Network

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the key networking paradigm for supporting the 
connectivity of massively distributed objects and numerous simultaneous applications. Routing 
Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a lightweight IPv6 network routing 
protocol specifically designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which can make 
full use of the energy of intelligent devices and compute the resource to build a flexible 
topological structure. This paper analyzes the security problems of RPL, sets up a test network to 
test RPL network security, simulate some attacks against the routing protocols in the network, 
and perform a quantitative assessment of the impacts of the attacks on the network.
